# Instacart Analysis
This project is for the analysis of Instacart an online grocery ordering service. Provided by Careerfoundry for their data analyitics program.
## Objective
Instacart has made many sale through their app but they want to uncover more of their customers spending habits on the app to better direct their marketing team towards their customers.
My task is to perform an analysis on their customer profiles to determine if there were any sales patterns that could help create target marking plans for these customers.
